<h1>Videogame Discovery App</h1>

This is a mini version of rawg website, a popular video game discovery platform.

In the first part of this project i developed many useful features, for example, we can toggle between dark and lightmode, search for games, filter by genre, as the games are loading we can see loading skeletons, we can filter by platform,
sort the games by different filters. Also i developed several UI patterns you'll see in modern applications.

Used technologies and tools:
- TypeScript
- Vite @4.0.1
